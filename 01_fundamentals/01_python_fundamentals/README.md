## Why Learn Python?
Python is a fantastic first language. A very smart dude named Guido Van Rossum modeled Python after the English language to make it easier to read and write than other programming languages.

In short, *Python gets out of your way so you can focus on learning how to program.*

One small shining example of this is Python's `print()` function. When you see that function's name, you know exactly what it does. Contrast this with Javascript's `console.log()` or Java's `system.out.println()`. A beginning programmer would most likely need to consult the documentation to know what that code means.

The platform lists other great reasons to learn Python, such as:
1. Popularity - Python is one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world.
2. Libraries - A wide range of libraries exist for the Python language for just about any task you can think of.
3. Community - The Python community is a very loyal, helpful, and robust community.
4. Scope - Python isn't only good for web development. It's used in machine learning, data science, game development, and more.
5. Ease - There isn't as much syntax to learn as there is in other languages. Python reads like English.

## The Zen of Python
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
